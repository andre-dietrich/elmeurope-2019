# Open-courSe development with LiaScript

<h4> (... or Markdown on steroids, featuring Elm) </h4>

Hi there and welcome to my talk about LiaScript, a Open-courSe authoring tool
for open educational content, which is based on a some simple Markdown
extension. When I started this project, I shortly realized that there is a huge
gap between people that want to create educational content and those who can. It
takes years to become a sophisticated web-developer, but it also takes years to
become fluent in veterinary opthalmology, cuniform writing or slavic literature.


      --{{1}}--
With LiaScript I tried to create a very simple and easy to learn and to adapt
approach for developing online courses. There is no login no server required and
everything happens within the browser. The entire course is hosted on GitHub and
everything that is required is actually a link to the Markdown-document. That is
the second link is a bit longer than the first one.

But probably it would be better if the system could introduce itself at the next
section.

## What is LiaScript
<!--

Hi, my name is Lia. LiaScript is not intended to be the next Markup language. It
is more or less a tool for creating interactive screencast-like online courses.
With an easy to read and write syntax.

You can use for example the double braces notation as bullet-points, to indicate
when something should appear or disappear.

## Prehistory

      --{{0}}--
But let me first start, with a little prehistory and how I started to become a
web-developer.

### SelectScript

![robots in a manucactoring hall](pics/robots.png)<!--width="100%"-->

      --{{0}}--
Originally I was a robotics and embedded systems developer, who become obseesed
with programming paradigms and how people try to solve problems or think
differently in different  languages. I even tried to develop my own programming
language that contained everything I liked in other programming languages or
stuff that I missed. But my problem though was, that I could not convince anyone
in the robotics community.

### Industrial eLab Project (BMBF)

      --{{0}}--
So when I thought my university carrear was over, a friend of mine approached to
to me and asked me, if I would like to join a project, called "Industrial eLab".
It was about teaching student embedded systems programming remotely on real
Arduino robots remotely. And I was like, PHP - so we meet again old friend.

       {{0-1}}
![php logo](pics/php.svg)<!--
style="width: 70%;
       display: block;
       margin-left: auto;
       margin-right: auto;" -->

      --{{1}}--
But then after some research, I stumbled accross this great projects elixir and
phoenix, which is increadible. Event with only little web-development experience
I could develop a system with user Management, an online editor and remote
compiler for Arduino.

       {{1-2}}
![elixir logo](pics/elixir.png)<!--
style="width: 70%;
       display: block;
       margin-left: auto;
       margin-right: auto;" -->

      --{{2}}--
But, every time that I tried to experiment a little bit with the system or
integrate a new feature, the system crashed. And mostly not because of Elixir,
but because of JavaScript. The more the system grew, the more intemedading it
was to update something.

        {{2}}
![editing](pics/editing.gif)<!--
style="width: 70%;
       display: block;
       margin-left: auto;
       margin-right: auto;" -->

      --{{3}}--
And so I did a little research and stumbled accross this language called elm.
Looks like Haskell, no runtime exceptions, staticaly typed, etc., that was not
so interesting as the model-view-controller approach, with only one global
state. This was genius and so I thought lets give it a try. After rebuilding the
UI with elm I realized that the system that I had developed so far, could also
be used to teach programming, operating system, iot and other stuff, but how
would I develop such content and deliver it to students, via pdfs, word, or
develop a website for every aspect? So the next idea that came into my mind, why
not using something like Markdown for creating online courses, but this time I
will add everything that I miss in Markdown to make it more interactive.

## Let's build a Markdown-interpreter with Elm

{{0}} Search for Markdown parsers in Elm: _only JavaScript_

      --{{0}}--
Let's build a Markdown interpreter in elm. Search for Markdown parsers written
in elm and extend them. Oh, there is one, but it is using JavaScript in the
back.


{{1}} Search for Parser libraries in Elm: ___Parser-Combinators???___

      --{{1}}--
Ok, wo here must be some parser libraries, that I can use. Well, it seems there
are, but what the heck is a parser combinator?


{{2}} AntLR and compile it to: No Elm! But JavaScript.

      --{{2}}--
I know AntLR and I know it can be used in many languages, so probably it does
also have an elm integration. Well, no, only JavaScript.


{{3}} What else: _Regular Expressions_

      --{{3}}--
Okay, I do not want to develop an entire programming language, so it should be
sufficient to use regular expression and some basic rules, right?

{{4}} Go back to: __step 1__

      --{{4}}--
After few hours I was wondering, what was this parser combinator thing again.


### Modularization (Elm)

      --{{0}}--
Developing parser the functional style is actually perfect and fits into the
common elm architecture process. In most cases you start with an initial app.

       {{0-1}}
<!--
style="width:  calc(100vh);"
class="animated fadeIn"
-->
`````````
.
├── App.elm
├── Lia.elm
└── LiaHelper.elm
`````````

      --{{1}}--
And the more your application grows, the more you start to separate parts into a
model, view, update, and some helper functions, but the same can be done for the
parser too.


       {{1-2}}
<!--
style="width:  calc(100vh * 0.8);"
class="animated fadeIn"
-->
`````````
.
├── App.elm
└── Lia
    ├── Model.elm
    ├── Parser.elm
    ├── Types.elm
    ├── Update.elm
    └── View.elm
`````````

      --{{2}}--
At the end, a parser is also a composition of many parsers, such as your view
is. And every parser is only responsible for a very tiny part, such as the quiz
and survery parser only have to perform one single task.

## LiaScript vs. LMS

      --{{0}}--
For the next part, I also did a little research and tried to analyze how
difficult it is to create online courses with common Learning Management
Systems, so called LMS. I therefor watched a couple of instructional YouTube
videos and counted clicks, the time for a task, how often the page had to be
changed and also what instructors said, whether it is quite easy or complicated.
The data and links can be found at the following link.

       {{0-1}}
> _From Hero to Zero with Learning Management Systems._

> https://osf.io/3rweg/

{{1}} **Multimedia**

      --{{1}}--
On average it takes 3 minutes to integrate something like video with too many
clicks an page changes. In most cases users also had to deal with the embed code
and thus leave their standard editor and switch to coding.

                           {{1}}
| System | time-on-task | # of clicks | # of pages | satisfaction |
|--------|-------------:|------------:|-----------:|-------------:|
| Canvas |        02:56 |        10.4 |        5.1 |         0.83 |
| Edmodo |        02:33 |         9.1 |        2.9 |         0.00 |
| ILIAS  |        02:59 |        11.2 |        5.3 |         0.00 |
| Moodle |        03:51 |        13.9 |        7.3 |         0.27 |


{{2}} **Quizzes**

      --{{2}}--
Quizzes are even more complicated, even for the instructors, one women even said
"what the f" during a recording, since her settings got lost a couple of times.

                           {{2}}
| System | time-on-task | # of clicks | # of pages | satisfaction |
|--------|-------------:|------------:|-----------:|-------------:|
| Canvas |        08:34 |        51.2 |       15.6 |         0.38 |
| Edmodo |        05:59 |        24.9 |        8.2 |        -0.10 |
| ILIAS  |        04:04 |        19.3 |        7.7 |         0.10 |
| Moodle |        08:33 |        47.5 |        9.9 |        -0.92 |

      --{{3}}--
Thus, the next part is intended to show, how easy these tasks can be solved with
a simple extension to Markdown.

### __Task:__ Integrating Multimedia Content

      --{{0}}--
If you know Markdown, then the first three types of links should be familiar to
you. A simple link, you can give it a name, if you put it into parentheses and
add some content in brackets at the beginning. And if you want to define an
image, you have to mark it with an exclamation mark in front of it. But that is
where Markdown ends.

 ?[sound](https://soundcloud.com/roddyricch/start-wit-me-feat-gunna)

!?[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4)

```

      --{{1}}--
In LiaScript you can add a question mark in front of it, to indicate a sound
file. With a bit of imagination this might resemble and ear. But next to
ordinary files, this works for example also for soundcloud.

        {{1}}
?[sound](https://soundcloud.com/roddyricch/start-wit-me-feat-gunna)

      --{{2}}--
And if you have an image with sound, then this can be interpreted as a video.
And the best thing about this is, if you are reading this document with a
Markdown reader of your choice, than these links are still valid Markdown links.
